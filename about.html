                <h1 class="fw-bold">Our Process</h1>
                <p>Change Agent works a little different than most marketing agencies. You don't start by buying a plan and then we throw basic content at you.</p>
                <p>We begin with a free initial analysis and consultation to determine where your business is today. From there, we'll brainstorm 3-5 potential website and marketing strategies, customized to you and your needs. These plans include both digital applications and human services, as well as projected KPIs and results.</p>
                <p>We'll then work with you to select which plan will be the most beneficial for your budget, timeline, and goals. Then, we assemble your team and start implementing- while you sit back and relax.</p>
